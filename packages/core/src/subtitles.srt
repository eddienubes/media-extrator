seatbelts are securely fastened.</i></font>

3
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:29,368
I don't speak german. I'm from Denver.
I'm from Den...

4
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,208
My friend, it's just an electrical storm.

5
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,368
I understand.

6
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,518
Here. Gum?

7
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:34,360
No, uh, thank you.

8
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,418
- Oh, my God.
- What?

9
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,308
- This bed is loud.
- You think?

10
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:26,978
We... We can't keep doing this.

11
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:28,658
Sneaking around.

12
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:32,028
Department's not a massive
fan of office romance.

13
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:35,008
The policy seminar
was endless, wasn't it?

14
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,088
I kept finding myself staring at you.

15
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,085
I decided to move my chair to stop.

16
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:44,078
- Well, I... I think Charlie knows.
- No, he doesn't know.

17
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:45,308
Well, I think he does.

18
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,049
If he knew, you would be transferred.

19
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,024
The idea of somebody
making a call whether or...

20
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,488
...not you and I get to live in the
same city that's unacceptable to me.

21
00:03:55,498 --> 00:04:00,058
Anyway, that's all just preamble
to the kicker, which is that...

22
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:01,693
...I love you.

23
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:31,732
Olivia Dunham.

24
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:37,719
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,767
Of course, sir.

26
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:43,575
Yes sir, I'm on my way.

27
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:49,081
Incident at Logan. International flight.
Charlie's on his way.

28
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,769
Agent Scott.

29
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:28,368
<font color="#80ff80"><i>We're gonna let the FBI take the lead.</i></font>

30
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,136
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

31
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:54,018
We got a flight out of Hamburg.
147 passengers.

32
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:56,738
Towers lost contact three hours in.

33
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:59,188
They thought it might have
been electrical interference.

34
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:02,298
They entered our airspace radio silent.

35
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:06,018
Navy then scrambles
two F-18s for escort.

36
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,248
They reported stains on the windows.

37
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:10,399
No signs of life aboard the jet.

38
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:16,078
White house approved a CDC request for
the jet not to be opened until they arrive.

39
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,178
No signs of life?
Who was flying the plane?

40
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:22,198
Logan's one of the first airports
with the pearl autopilot system.

41
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,628
Plane landed itself right on time.

42
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:27,008
Unlike every flight I've ever taken.

43
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:30,656
Well, let me assure you we'd be happy
to treat you as family too.

44
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:34,678
Good old NTSB.
They all like to think they're cops.

45
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:38,218
- Agent Scott.
- Agent Francis. Agent Dunham.

46
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,818
Whatever the hell McNeary
saw through that window...

47
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:44,506
...it made him throw up in
front of his whole unit.

48
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,531
Excuse me.

49
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:55,108
So what's going on here?
Some sort of accident?

50
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:56,398
Tarmac's closed.

51
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:57,608
Nothing you need to worry about, sir.

52
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,498
Oh, all right.

53
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:00,068
- Move along.
- I'll do that.

54
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:02,838
Thanks.

55
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:14,918
Although this is a joint task force...

56
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:18,438
...you're all now reporting to the
department of homeland security.

57
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:21,508
I'm special agent in charge, Broyles.

58
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:24,728
D.C. has sent me here to
make sure we get results.

59
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:28,427
Standard level four hazmat
suits are required to go in.

60
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,223
Members from each agency on
the starting line as follows.

61
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:35,426
CIA, Baronoff.

62
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:39,458
FBI, Charlie Francis and John Scott.

63
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,165
Everyone else stand by.

64
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:44,632
Okay, people, let's move.

65
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,208
Sir!

66
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,978
Olivia Dunham, FBI interagency liaison.

67
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:53,793
Liaison on an interagency
task force. Gotta love that.

68
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:56,668
Kind of like powdered
sugar on a glazed donut.

69
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,454
Excuse me, if I'm gonna do 
my job effectively...

70
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:01,368
...I like my information first-hand.

71
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,342
That's not redundancy.
That's accountability.

72
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,339
I know exactly who you are.

73
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:12,378
You want in, liaison?

74
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:13,548
Suit up.

75
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:58,555
What kind of terrorism is this?

76
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,032
Who says it's terrorism?

77
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:23,238
<font color="#15fcff">Sources tell us the plane
was deliberately set ablaze by...</font>

78
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:26,398

remains had been removed...</font>

79
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,293
I've got 15E.

80
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:35,418
Seat 41a, John Rosenbloom.
Honolulu, Hawaii. Car salesman.

81
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:37,209
Criminal history's negative.

82
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:40,253
Have we reviewed video
from the Hamburg airport?

83
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,042
We need to see if any passengers
would show any signs of illness.

84
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,308
On its way, Agent Dawson.

85
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,558
And what the hell is taking
so long with that black box?

86
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,148
Please tell me that terminal's shutdown.

87
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:52,058
It's been down since 0400 local.
You got any more questions?

88
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,178
Who's point from CDC on the bone,
tissue and air samples?

89
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,338
Agent Paley. You want his home number?

90
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,688
No, but I'd like the whole report.

91
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,778
- And not just this fax...
- We're on that too liaison.

92
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:04,418
We don't think what happened on that
plane was a result of the in-flight movie.

93
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:09,968
Back bay pd got a call at 0300 from
a guard on duty at a storage facility.

94
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:15,408
He saw two, and I quote, "suspicious middle
eastern men" handing a white guy a briefcase.

95
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:18,645
Liaison, take it. Go find out.

96
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,478
Take what? That?

97
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,868
You're telling me that's my assignment?

98
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:24,685
Yeah, honey. Would you mind?

99
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:29,548
<font color="#15fcff">...in conjunction with the
center for disease control...</font>

100
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:34,118
<font color="#15fcff">...the decision was made to burn the
plane only after it was determined...</font>

101
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:42,468
Petty bastard.

102
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:45,918
He's pissed because his best friend
sexually assaulted three marine privates...

103
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,928
...and I'm the bad guy
'cause I put him away.

104
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,208
Broyles is an idiot.

105
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,908
You're smarter, you're stronger,
you're much better looking.

106
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,097
He's jealous.

107
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:56,417
What?

108
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,494
You said you loved me.

109
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,159
In the motel.

110
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:03,823
Yeah.

111
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:08,198
That was a big deal.

112
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,754
Yeah, well, you didn't say
anything back, so I just let it go.

113
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:15,358
I've been sort of bad
at this for a long time.

114
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,375
Until you.

115
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:26,036
I wanted to say I love you too.

116
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,636
Let's go check the trash together.

117
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:00,768
Empty.

118
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:02,828
Acetylene, propane?

119
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:05,258
No, ammonia.

120
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:12,568
What are you doing?

121
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:15,264
What are you doing? I'm a federal agent.

122
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:40,348
We need to get a chem
transport team out here now.

123
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,918
I'm on it.

124
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,108
No signal.

125
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,718
Freeze! FBI!

126
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:13,101
I have a gun! I will shoot!

127
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:26,378
John?

128
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,288
<i>We got a runner in the back.
We need him alive.</i>

129
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:29,752
I'm on my way.

130
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:49,796
- Hands in the air!
- John!

131
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,918
John.

132
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,338
You were very lucky today, Agent Dunham.

133
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:44,747
Your wounds could've easily
been much more severe.

134
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:48,942
Agent Scott wasn't as fortunate.

135
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,840
While he survived the initial blast...

136
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:55,543
...Agent Scott was exposed to some
synthetic chemical compounds.

137
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,967
Work that was done
in the labs you found.

138
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,578
He's not contagious,
but until we understand more...

139
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:09,265
...it's better not to introduce
any additional contaminants.

140
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:16,714
We haven't been able to identify
the substance that's affecting him.

141
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:19,938
The CDC has sent in specialists, but...

142
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:22,598
...well, they've never seen anything
like what's happening here.

143
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:25,418
We've put agent Scott
in a drug-induced coma.

144
00:15:25,428 --> 00:15:29,525
His body temperature has been lowered
significantly to try and slow the progress.

145
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:43,986
I'm sorry, agent Dunham.

146
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,293
It's me.

147
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,206
Liaison.

148
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:54,197
I found a connection between the Hamburg
flight and what's happened to agent Scott.

149
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:02,317
His name's Walter Bishop.

150
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,137
He's a scientific
researcher from Cambridge.

151
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,387
Born in '46, Harvard educated.

152
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:08,237
Post grad at Oxford and M.I.T.

153
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,597
Look at the experiments
he was doing in the '70s.

154
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:13,257
I believe dr. Bishop might have
information that might tell us...

155
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:16,657
...what happened aboard that plane
and save agent Scott's life.

156
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,977
Says the guy's been at
st. Claire's for 17 years.

157
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:22,967
I saw that. An assistant
was killed in his lab.

158
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:25,977
Rumors about dr. Bishop
using humans as guinea pigs.

159
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:29,237
He was charged with manslaughter,
but was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.

160
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,847
Why are you so sure
Bishop's worth our time?

161
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,017
Why are you so sure he's not?

162
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,757
Listen, Dunham, you and I
got off on the wrong foot...

163
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:38,397
If my past job performance as U.S.
Marine special investigator offends you...

164
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:42,247
Well, yeah, it does.

165
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:44,841
A man who serves his
country for 30 years has...

166
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:46,517
...a few drinks and a
small lapse in judgment...

167
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,197
- ...does not deserve five years.
- A small lapse in judgment that...

168
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,437
...will haunt three young women
for the rest of their lives.

169
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:53,120
But that's not tonight's business, is it?

170
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,995
Look, D.C. has tasked me to make sure...

171
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:59,007
...that our reaction to flight
627 is beyond reproach.

172
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:03,567
Now it says here, in 1991
the glorious state of Massachusetts...

173
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:06,014
...forbade dr. Bishop
from having any visitors...

174
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,817
...with the exception of immediate family.

175
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,597
So from where I sit...

176
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,477
...barging into a mental institution 
waving the patriot act...

177
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:15,527
...which is what you'd need...

178
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:18,120
...and demanding face time
with some old lab rat...

179
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,472
...who you think might be
behind some of the most...

180
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,877
...terrifying terror that I
can possibly imagine...

181
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:24,507
I'm coming to you with a solid lead...

182
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:27,297
- ...and your personal resentment is preventing you...
- And you're wasting your breath and my time.

183
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,277
Do you understand "immediate family?"

184
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:34,557
You want to question dr. Bishop, you go find
his next of kin and have 'em escort you in.

185
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:39,347
Talk to Bishop, uncover something substantial,
and I will have your back.

186
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:42,988
Until then, I am not so convinced.

187
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:45,589
Now can you handle that?

188
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,732
He does have a son.

189
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:53,794
Is his son local too?

190
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,493
Not exactly.

191
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:07,337
<i>So, this guy's Walter Bishop's son.</i>

192
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,687
<i>His name's Peter Bishop.</i>

193
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:13,167
<i>He's a high school dropout, I.Q.At 190,
which is 50 points north of genius.</i>

194
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:14,827
<i>Misfit, nomad.</i>

195
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:17,017
<i>Hasn't kept a job
longer than two months.</i>

196
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:20,337
<i>He's been a wild land,
fireman, cargo pilot...</i>

197
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:23,316
<i>...and briefly a college
chemistry professor.</i>

198
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:25,597
<i>He falsified a degree from M.I.T.</i>

199
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:29,227
<i>And even managed to get a few papers
published before he was found out.</i>

200
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:32,053
<i>Sounds like a massive pain in the ass.</i>

201
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,057
My resume is hardly traditional.

202
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:39,547
But around these parts,
traditional increasingly means irrelevant.

203
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,967
$100 billion sunk into infrastructure
and you can barely keep the lights on.

204
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:45,118
So you need someone
to oversee construction...

205
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:47,104
...on 600 miles of pipeline
to carry crude between...

206
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:48,747
...your fields in kirkuk
and the port of ceyhan.

207
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:53,857
A job well outside the green zone,
I might add, while I'm still alive to do so.

208
00:19:57,137 --> 00:20:00,367
You'll need someone who has a handle
on the laws of hydrodynamic resistance.

209
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:02,207
The heat exchange in oil mixture flows.

210
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,327
You'll also need someone who can
work with mixed integer programs...

211
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,896
...'cause you're gonna
have to resize the pipes...

212
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:07,637
...as you start working
across uneven terrain.

213
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:11,408
That is, if you want to keep
down construction costs.

214
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:20,224
I also speak farsi.

215
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:26,347
And 600,000 all in sounds fair.

216
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:32,697
Peter Bishop.

217
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:35,192
Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI.

218
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,364
- Okay.
- You've heard of flight 627?

219
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:41,817
The Hamburg flight, of course.

220
00:20:41,827 --> 00:20:43,917
You may be able to help us with that.

221
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,257
No, I think you got the wrong guy.

222
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,739
Your father is Walter Bishop.

223
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,267
You know, the last time somebody
asked me that it was an accusation.

224
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:55,377
Well, he's the man we're looking to speak 
with but due to his current status...

225
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,187
...you're the only one who
can provide us access.

226
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:59,397
And what possible help
could that man be to you?

227
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,787
And what is it exactly that
you're expecting me to do?

228
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:04,107
Hop on a plane with you
back to Massachusetts?

229
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,497
I just got here, honey.

230
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,757
I can have you on a return flight
here in four days, but first...

231
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,077
Let me save you the time.

232
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:11,057
I'd rather stay here in Iraq.

233
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,217
That's how much I want to see my father.

234
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:16,377
I'm going to beg you as
one human being to another.

235
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:19,887
Your father may be able to
save someone who's dying.

236
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,610
Someone I care about very much.

237
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:31,735
Sweetheart, we all care
about someone who's dying.

238
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:33,891
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

239
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,887
I know why you're here!

240
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:43,043
I have your file.

241
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,307
What file?

242
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,852
The one the FBI would say doesn't exist.

243
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:52,867
And it has everything.

244
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:55,477
Where you've been,
what you're running from.

245
00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:59,724
And what you need while you're here.

246
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,013
So either you come with me...

247
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,327
...or I let certain people
know your whereabouts.

248
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:13,379
When do we leave?

249
00:22:17,897 --> 00:22:19,861
Did the doctors say anything else?

250
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:21,688
Yeah.

251
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,641
Thanks, Charlie.

252
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:30,200
Let me ask you something.

253
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,390
My father, not my favorite.

254
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,871
He is, without a doubt,
the most self-absorbed, twisted...

255
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:41,960
...abusive, brilliant, myopic
son of a bitch on the planet.

256
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,174
So he was a chemist.

257
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,526
That much I already know.

258
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,152
He worked out of a basement lab in Harvard
doing research for a toothpaste company.

259
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,632
I also know that there was an
accident at the lab one night...

260
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:59,202
...that my father was arrested, beginning the
first truly peaceful period in our home.

261
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:01,995
But here's the thing, Olivia.

262
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:08,036
My gut tells me that your friend's life,
the one hanging in the balance...

263
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:11,412
...not gonna be saved by
a tube of toothpaste.

264
00:23:19,184 --> 00:23:22,821
He worked out of Harvard,
but not on toothpaste.

265
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:27,761
He was part of a classified U.S.Army
experimental program called "Kelvin genetics".

266
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:31,701
They gave him the resources
to do whatever work he wanted...

267
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:35,747
...which was primarily in an
area called "Fringe science".

268
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,611
When you say "Fringe science",
you mean pseudoscience.

269
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,561
I suppose.

270
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:47,711
Things like mind control,
teleportation, astral projection...

271
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,895
...invisibility, genetic mutation...

272
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,846
- ...reanimation, fertility...
- Whoa, Excuse for a sec.

273
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:55,004
Reanimation? Really?

274
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,207
So you're telling me what?

275
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,082
My father was dr. Frankenstein?

276
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:47,273
You know what?

277
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,054
Why don't you go on ahead?

278
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,510
Dr. Bishop, special day.
You have a visitor.

279
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:15,823
Hello.

280
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:33,251
I knew someone would come... eventually.

281
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,257
Dr. Bishop.

282
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:44,998
Dr. Bishop?

283
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,489
And you said this was...
When did this happen?

284
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:55,319
The incident on the plane
happened four days ago.

285
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:56,519
Agent Scott was injured the next day.

286
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:00,709
The dermis already indurated, translucent.

287
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,229
M-muscular tissue visible.

288
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,549
On Scott, you mean,
can you see through skin?

289
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,499
Yes.

290
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:06,549
Oh, that's not good.

291
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:10,449
To see through the skin, it's...
it's tricky, it's advanced.

292
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:12,839
- Like that it's tricky.
- What's happening to him?

293
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:14,735
Can it be reversed?

294
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:21,942
What is it?

295
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,220
They... they have this horrible...

296
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,664
...pudding here.

297
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,389
Butterscotch pudding on mondays.
It's dreadful.

298
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,971
It's thursday.

299
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:46,569
Oh, that's fantastic news.

300
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:55,111
It can be reversed.

301
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,499
What happened to your colleague.

302
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,989
Years ago I worked with lab animals,
and... and...

303
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:06,974
...some of them were afflicted,
but were saved.

304
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,704
So do you remember what to do?

305
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:31,778
This place, their...
their choice of therapies has c... c...

306
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,886
Dr. Bishop.

307
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:43,613
You came here today with my son.

308
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:50,640
I'm not allowed visitors, you see,
except immediate family.

309
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:57,603
And unless the order has been lifted,
then it's a simple if/then formula.

310
00:27:57,614 --> 00:28:00,550
If you are here, then so is he.

311
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,866
I would... so much...

312
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:10,107
...so very much like to see him.

313
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,586
So much.

314
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:24,785
He asked for you.

315
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,749
Thanks, sweetheart.

316
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,959
I really appreciate that.

317
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:32,179
Hey, I didn't tell him you were here.

318
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:35,242
And call me "sweetheart" one
more time. I'd really like that.

319
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:05,819
Hello, Walter.

320
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,510
I thought you'd be fatter.

321
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:16,158
You thought I would be fatter.

322
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:19,219
Excellent first words, perfect.

323
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:21,899
No, as a boy, you were rounder.

324
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:24,409
Yes, I was until the
summer before high school.

325
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,019
Not that I'd expect
you to remember that.

326
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:27,089
May I see something?

327
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:29,189
What are you doing?
Take your hands off of me!

328
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:33,159
Pupils are good. They're good.
Thank goodness.

329
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:36,349
How advanced is your
colleague's condition?

330
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,979
Which... Which is something I... I... I...

331
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:45,106
I'm unable to deduce without
a firsthand examination.

332
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,329
I must see mr. Scott myself.

333
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:51,912
Which I am unable to do.

334
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,379
Well, under present law.

335
00:29:54,389 --> 00:30:00,896
Unless... unless signed out by a legal
guardian who must be, once again, a relative.

336
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:02,664
What are you asking me to...

337
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,652
No. Guardian? No, forget it.

338
00:30:05,663 --> 00:30:07,328
- He'll do it.
- No, I will not.

339
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,649
One phone call. That's all it takes.
You want me to make it?

340
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,137
'Cause I got my phone in my pocket.

341
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,792
Now it's out of my pocket.

342
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:22,702
You wanted my father.

343
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:25,171
Now you've got my father.

344
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:29,108
Which falls into the category of
be careful what you wish for...

345
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:30,870
...sweetheart.

346
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,530
<font color="#15fcff">...every effort is being made to
understand what happened on flight 627...</font>

347
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:34,885
Dr. Bishop, I was curious.

348
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:37,296
Did anyone else ever
have access to your work?

349
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:42,916
Well, the assistants had bits and pieces.

350
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:46,142
And God, I suppose.

351
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:51,246
I supposed the only one that really
knew what I was doing was Belly.

352
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:51,956
Who?

353
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,416
Belly, William Bell.
He and I shared the lab.

354
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:55,026
William Bell?

355
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:58,056
You shared your lab with the
founder of Massive Dynamic?

356
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,896
I'm sorry, I don't know what that is,
Massive Dynamic.

357
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:03,166
Oh, nothing really.
Just a tiny little company.

358
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:04,576
That's perfect.

359
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:06,906
One guys becomes one of the
wealthiest men on the planet.

360
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:10,216
The other guy becomes an
institutionalized psychopath.

361
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:12,546
What? What happened?

362
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,916
I just pissed myself.

363
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:17,746
- Excellent.
- Just a squirt.

364
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,436
I just got your message. How's John?

365
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:36,466
Worse.

366
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:39,806
CDC says the Hamburg flight was
caused by a synthetic compound.

367
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:43,046
Which is like saying rain
is caused by a wet compound.

368
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:46,026
They've run some tests on John,
but haven't come back with anything.

369
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:46,996
What about Bishop?

370
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:50,276
Left to right, insane and irritating.

371
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:52,296
And also my only hope.

372
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:54,866
Listen...

373
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:57,266
I need to question William Bell.

374
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,796
Could you set that up for me?

375
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:00,466
William Bell?

376
00:33:00,476 --> 00:33:02,066
Massive Dynamic William Bell?

377
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:05,636
He and Bishop used to share a lab.

378
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:08,326
You're kidding.

379
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:52,610
Dr. Bishop?

380
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:14,496
Is there Ginger Ale? Any Ginger Ale?

381
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:20,456
I haven't had some in a long time.
I miss it.

382
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:26,936
Can we please get some Ginger Ale
for the doctor, agent Farnsworth?

383
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,156
Sure.

384
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,666
Whoa! Stop right now! Stop!

385
00:34:31,676 --> 00:34:33,742
Does this not concern you?

386
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:40,738
Let him go.

387
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,619
Petri dish.

388
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:56,636
Quick, please.

389
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:08,947
Good.

390
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:12,080
I need to take this
to my lab right away.

391
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:15,476
- Your what?
- Kresge building basement, Harvard.

392
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:16,646
We should leave.

393
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,676
I have my sample.

394
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:20,755
Your lab was shutdown after you left.

395
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:24,079
I'm sorry?

396
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,733
Wake up. It's gone.

397
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,266
No.

398
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,996
No, no, no.

399
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,226
No, no, no, no, no, no.

400
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,736
Walter, there is no lab.

401
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:37,746
- It's a perfect working...
- No!

402
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:40,416
Damn you, damn you!

403
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:43,203
We need to get him back immediately.

404
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,766
Liaison.

405
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,686
- When did you get back?
- I need your help.

406
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:54,770
I want you to know I've successfully had...

407
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,946
...dr. Walter Bishop
released from st.Claire's...

408
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:59,836
...and he requires the use
of his old laboratory.

409
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:00,716
I'm sorry, what?

410
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:04,246
Kresge building. Harvard, basement.

411
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:08,336
The university's been using it
for storage for the last 17 years.

412
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:11,916
It would be nice to think
that your tenacity in this case...

413
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:16,306
...is a byproduct of a remarkable
and robust professionalism.

414
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,946
But I can't help but wonder...

415
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:24,140
...if there wasn't something going
on between you and agent Scott.

416
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:27,030
Get the lab for Bishop.

417
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,516
So much.

418
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:54,439
So much happened here.

419
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:59,756
And so much is about to.

420
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:16,781
Dr. Bishop, I've ordered a
standard forensics work package.

421
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,552
Is there anything else you need?

422
00:37:18,563 --> 00:37:21,863
Um, optical coherence
tomograph for flesh study.

423
00:37:22,122 --> 00:37:24,611
2,000 pounds of silicon.

424
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:29,412
At least five anonymous blood
samples from volunteer donors.

425
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:31,432
Microorganism detector.

426
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:33,782
NASA grade, of course.
There's still NASA, yes?

427
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:34,792
Yes.

428
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:37,402
Oh, she's still here!

429
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:39,562
Oh, this tank was the best.

430
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:41,732
And a two-year-old bos taurus.

431
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:42,982
A what?

432
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,882
A cow.

433
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:46,132
He wants a cow.

434
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:48,912
Purebred, not crossbred.
This is important.

435
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,922
Mature weight, 850 pounds.

436
00:37:51,932 --> 00:37:55,602
Internal fat average of 2.37

437
00:37:55,612 --> 00:37:56,702
Is he joking?

438
00:37:56,712 --> 00:38:00,892
Genetically, humans and cows are
separated by only a couple lines of dna.

439
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:02,742
So it's an ethical test subject.

440
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,602
Where'd you learn that? M.I.T?

441
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:06,032
No, actually.

442
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,022
I picked that up reading books.

443
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:10,522
You should try it sometime. It's fun.

444
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:16,725
Get him the cow.

445
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:18,654
Fantastic, thank you.

446
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:21,402
The only thing better
than a cow is a human.

447
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:24,852
Unless you need milk.
Then you really need a cow.

448
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:13,062
Coffee?

449
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:14,858
Thanks.

450
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:16,672
Tell me.

451
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:21,077
What else did that file say
about yours truly? How bad was it?

452
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:24,242
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

453
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,742
Why don't you go ahead and liberate
yourself 'cause I'm here now...

454
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:30,552
...so I kind of feel like I
deserve the truth, don't you?

455
00:39:38,353 --> 00:39:40,043
There was no file.

456
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:42,653
- I needed you back here.
- So that was what? You were bluffing?

457
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:43,793
I... I was desperate.

458
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,693
You know, I'm usually pretty
good at reading people.

459
00:39:45,703 --> 00:39:46,933
That's sort of what I do.

460
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:49,483
Yeah, well, I could see you were
in trouble. Anyone could see that.

461
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:51,856
So I could've stayed.

462
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:54,363
I could've stayed in Iraq.

463
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:57,353
You know, a car bomb went
off this morning in Kirkuk.

464
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:59,563
You might just owe me a thank you.

465
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,993
Yeah, well, I owe a lot.

466
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:05,923
Tsk, yeah, I figured. Mafia.

467
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,103
A guy named big Eddie.

468
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:09,993
You owe money to a guy
nicknamed big Eddie?

469
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:12,073
No, I owe money to a guy named big Eddie.

470
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,993
He had it legally changed.

471
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:17,603
And the thing is, I'm not even a gambler.
I mean, I never was. It just...

472
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:22,243
It just... a couple years ago
I went a bit crazy.

473
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,453
I thought you were a genius.
You must've had a system.

474
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,283
Of course there was a system.

475
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,753
The house was cheating.

476
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:29,763
But you try telling 'em that.

477
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:36,593
'72 during Vietnam.

478
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:41,583
The D.O.D.'S biochem division had
us working on a leprotic contagion...

479
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:44,213
...for possible use against the vietcong.

480
00:40:44,223 --> 00:40:50,623
It's possible that whatever affected that
plane may have been derived from that work.

481
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:51,703
What about John?

482
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:54,377
What's infecting him is merely a chemical...

483
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,033
...reaction to the raw
laboratory ingredients...

484
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:58,830
...not the finished contagion.

485
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:00,783
Which means we can
synthesize a counteragent.

486
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,343
- So you can help him.
- don't do that.

487
00:41:02,353 --> 00:41:03,703
Don't give her false hope.

488
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:06,093
There's no false. It's
not false. It's real.

489
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:08,013
I could help, yes.

490
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:12,183
If I had a precise inventory of what was
in that storage facility when it detonated.

491
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:13,493
We don't have it.

492
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,953
It all went up, everything.

493
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:17,003
And the suspect who might
have those answers got away...

494
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:19,343
...and John was the only
one who saw his face.

495
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:22,513
So how long does he have left?

496
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:25,863
Current rate of crystallization,
cellular degradation...

497
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:28,873
- How long?
- 24 hours.

498
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:32,523
His brain will no longer
be able to oxygenate itself.

499
00:41:35,503 --> 00:41:37,403
I'm so sorry...

500
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:41,403
...that I can't offer you a
less dangerous solution.

501
00:41:44,223 --> 00:41:45,683
What do you mean?

502
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:46,713
Didn't I mention it?

503
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:48,973
Whatever you think you
said, you didn't say.

504
00:41:48,983 --> 00:41:50,513
The synaptic transfer system.

505
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:51,793
The shared dream state.

506
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,523
What do you mean shared dream state?

507
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:57,973
The human brain generates a
quantifiable electric field.

508
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:02,413
I posited in 1976 that it is possible...

509
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:05,943
...to synchronize the fields
of two distinct minds...

510
00:42:05,953 --> 00:42:10,583
...to allow the sharing of information
across the unconscious state.

511
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:12,923
Like a string between two tin cans.

512
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:14,063
You know what's great about that?

513
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,733
Is that it's completely insane.

514
00:42:16,753 --> 00:42:20,253
You're saying I can
talk to John in a coma...

515
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:23,573
...and he can tell me what
the suspect looks like.

516
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,863
- It's not an exact science.
- It's not even science.

517
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:28,003
Have you done this before?

518
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:33,393
I have used this technique to extract
information from a corpse once.

519
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:36,333
You can do that if they haven't
been dead for longer than six hours.

520
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:38,713
Right, 'cause after six hours,
that's when they're really dead.

521
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,933
You could access his memories.

522
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:42,783
Assuming there's no brain damage.

523
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,933
Of course you'd have to
have an electromagnetic probe...

524
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:50,773
...placed in the base of your skull whilst
immersed without clothing in the old tank.

525
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:53,693
And you'd be heavily drugged.

526
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:00,623
What sort of drugs?

527
00:43:00,633 --> 00:43:05,583
Oh, a mix of ketamine, neurontin,
lysergic acid diethylamide.

528
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:08,133
That last one is LSD,
by the way... acid.

529
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:09,323
Take at least a few hours.

530
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:11,833
I'd need your help to synthesize
it if it's not too much trouble.

531
00:43:11,843 --> 00:43:14,043
Yeah, sure, no problem.
That sounds like fun.

532
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:16,223
The man who was just released
from the mental institution...

533
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:18,183
...he wants to give you a drug overdose...

534
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:19,875
...then stick a metal
rod into your head and...

535
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:22,273
...put you naked into 
a rusty tank of water.

536
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:24,383
No, I don't want to.

537
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,243
No, I'd rather not.
I'm just saying I can.

538
00:43:27,253 --> 00:43:30,033
Okay, Olivia, excuse me for sec.

539
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:32,223
Now you're obviously
under severe duress...

540
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:34,743
...and you haven't slept since Iraq,
and the man you care about might die...

541
00:43:34,753 --> 00:43:37,003
...but I'm telling you
that man will kill you.

542
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:40,069
You don't understand the procedure.

543
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:45,533
John would do it for me.

544
00:43:46,903 --> 00:43:47,873
Set it up.

545
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:50,883
I'll get DHS authorization
to bring John here.

546
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:55,863
This is unbelievable. This
is insane! He is insane!

547
00:43:55,873 --> 00:43:58,373
And you're insane for following him.

548
00:43:58,623 --> 00:43:59,953
Excellent.

549
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:02,263
Let's make some LSD.

550
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:22,256
Put him over here.

551
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:38,623
Salt'll make you float.

552
00:44:41,423 --> 00:44:44,283
Charlie, did you get me
in to see William Bell?

553
00:44:44,293 --> 00:44:47,823
Massive Dynamic isn't exactly
being forthcoming or courteous.

554
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,983
And apparently, William Bell is out
of the country for the next two weeks.

555
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:51,883
What's this?

556
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:54,703
A sweet little memo from
their general counsel.

557
00:44:54,713 --> 00:44:55,993
So Bell doesn't want to talk?

558
00:44:56,003 --> 00:44:58,813
Or he's just being the head
of a $50 billion corporation.

559
00:44:58,823 --> 00:44:59,843
Oh, screw this.

560
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:03,073
I want to drive a tank through William
Bell's office and find out what he knows.

561
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,963
I know you do, but I'm here
to tell you the bad news.

562
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:08,876
It's gonna be another 48 hours
till we get a court order.

563
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:11,387
You should probably
strip to your underwear.

564
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,323
Hello.

565
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:16,143
What the hell was that?

566
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:17,733
Charlie, we don't have 48 hours.

567
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:19,643
I need you to get to Bell.

568
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:22,743
If Walter fails, Bell could
be the only one to save us.

569
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,183
Livvy, what's happening here?

570
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,823
You've cleared all this with Broyles?

571
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:29,013
Somewhat.

572
00:45:29,023 --> 00:45:31,723
Somewhat doesn't sound good.

573
00:45:34,723 --> 00:45:35,903
Is that a cow?

574
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:37,123
Yeah, that's Gene.

575
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:41,733
Listen, Charlie, I... I need you to
promise me you'll do whatever you can.

576
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:44,963
Of course. You know that.

577
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:48,633
Hey!

578
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:50,683
Be careful.

579
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,146
My God.

580
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:26,593
Now where was I?

581
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:30,103
Could you tilt your
head forward, please.

582
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:35,773
I still think that this is deeply
irresponsible, and believe me, I would know.

583
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:40,253
This is an anesthetic.

584
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,573
I feel normal working.

585
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:45,873
Yeah, 'cause bootlegging smack in the
basement is just the picture of normalcy.

586
00:46:54,023 --> 00:46:56,823
I got you. I got you.

587
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,650
I hope your guy is worth it.

588
00:47:20,448 --> 00:47:22,048
And this...

589
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:25,963
...will rip open your consciousness.

590
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:51,346
Listen, in case, you
don't come back, I just...

591
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:58,125
...wanted to say before we do this, how
much I appreciate what you've done.

592
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:02,303
There are so many things you'll
lose in a place like that.

593
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:04,513
You lose being trusted.

594
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:09,003
Strange how important
that is once it's gone.

595
00:48:44,136 --> 00:48:46,652
If you want to watch,
you can come closer.

596
00:48:46,663 --> 00:48:48,083
Do you work here?

597
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,796
Yeah, I'm Astrid Farnsworth,
assistant to agent Dunham.

598
00:48:51,806 --> 00:48:52,806
Who?

599
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:56,176
Oh, yes. I'm Walter...

600
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,376
Bishop, Walter Bishop.

601
00:48:57,387 --> 00:48:58,435
Yes, thank you.

602
00:48:58,446 --> 00:48:59,686
Don't mention it.

603
00:48:59,696 --> 00:49:02,206
These are her brain rhythms.

604
00:49:02,216 --> 00:49:07,406
More important than most people know
regarding cerebral regional interaction.

605
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:08,766
Critical.

606
00:49:08,776 --> 00:49:10,946
And... and these are his.

607
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:13,801
As the drugs take
effect, the probes will...

608
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:16,526
...synchronize the
electrical signals from both.

609
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:20,146
That's what the brain
is, an electrical router.

610
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:22,521
Should be able to be
interpreted by the other.

611
00:49:22,532 --> 00:49:25,376
Yeah, simple really. Like making taffy.

612
00:49:25,386 --> 00:49:31,416
Then when the rhythms are in synch, they
should be in the same place, so to speak.

613
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,262
So what do we do now?

614
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:39,351
Now we wait.

615
00:50:19,536 --> 00:50:20,936
What was that?

616
00:50:45,144 --> 00:50:48,044
Hello. Hello!

617
00:50:50,736 --> 00:50:55,536
I think I'm here. 
I think I'm here. I'm here.

618
00:51:09,446 --> 00:51:10,946
John?

619
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:15,402
That's my uncle's kayak.

620
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:23,038
John?

621
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:25,736
Is that you?

622
00:51:32,504 --> 00:51:33,804
Olivia.

623
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:35,731
John.

624
00:51:39,223 --> 00:51:40,560
- What's happening?
- She's fine.

625
00:51:40,571 --> 00:51:42,171
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

626
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:44,281
- You sure?
- Look.

627
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:55,051
I was just thinking about you.

628
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:18,183
What was that?

629
00:52:19,631 --> 00:52:21,031
Nothing.

630
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:30,601
John... you were hurt.

631
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:34,361
I don't remember.

632
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:36,684
Think.

633
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,621
The storage units.

634
00:52:40,986 --> 00:52:42,586
I feel cold.

635
00:52:43,821 --> 00:52:45,821
I need you to remember.

636
00:52:46,441 --> 00:52:48,141
Remember what?

637
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:52,691
What you saw.

638
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:55,861
I need you to show me his face.

639
00:52:57,281 --> 00:52:58,581
Why?

640
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:06,361
So I can save you.

641
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:09,831
Please try.

642
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:13,781
Try and remember.

643
00:53:28,066 --> 00:53:31,466
Yes, this is right. This is right.

644
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,527
We got a runner in the back.
We need him alive.

645
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:54,201
I can't see his face.

646
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:11,521
Her leg!

647
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:12,921
Oh, I saw him!

648
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:16,932
I saw John get hurt. I was there.
I was there, I saw... I saw him.

649
00:54:31,293 --> 00:54:33,793
What do you mean you saw him? Where?

650
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,704
I told you not to ask me that.

651
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:40,619
This is him. This is the suspect
we're looking for. He looks like this.

652
00:54:40,663 --> 00:54:42,463
Send me the image.
I'll put it through the database.

653
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:45,263
Have you slept? You look like crap.

654
00:54:45,265 --> 00:54:47,365
No primary matches for criminal record.

655
00:54:47,393 --> 00:54:49,553
Well, cross-check all
state driver license files...

656
00:54:49,564 --> 00:54:51,514
...and send this image
to all local hospitals.

657
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:54,525
Agent Dunham, take a look at this.

658
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,571
Oh, my God. This is him.

659
00:55:01,703 --> 00:55:03,503
He was a passenger on flight 627.

660
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,063
- I don't... I don't understand.
- Wait, wait, wait.

661
00:55:05,073 --> 00:55:06,373
He couldn't have been
at the storage place.

662
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:09,584
- Charlie, I saw him there.
- Hold on, guys.

663
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:12,472
Morgan Steig was passenger number 108.

664
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:16,123
His emergency contact, Richard Steig.

665
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:17,833
You're telling me he has a twin?

666
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:20,833
Yeah, no home address, only
a history of employment.

667
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:22,585
What?

668
00:55:22,596 --> 00:55:24,796
Richard Steig's last employer.

669
00:55:31,403 --> 00:55:33,403
I was hoping to speak with William Bell.

670
00:55:33,473 --> 00:55:35,973
I'm Nina Sharp, executive director.

671
00:55:36,063 --> 00:55:37,663
I only have a few minutes.

672
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:42,023
Our primary suspect is a former
employee of yours, Richard Steig.

673
00:55:42,043 --> 00:55:44,093
Who may have used
research from your company...

674
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,150
...to develop a
self-eradicating airborne toxin.

675
00:55:47,173 --> 00:55:49,403
We don't know why or
for whom, but it appears...

676
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:51,780
...he was willing to
sacrifice his own brother.

677
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:56,033
Whatever killed those people on that
plane got onboard through his insulin pen.

678
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:59,543
So do you want to talk to me?

679
00:56:07,773 --> 00:56:09,273
Danielle...

680
00:56:09,763 --> 00:56:13,963
...please assemble everything we have on
Richard Steig for agent Dunham here.

681
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,333
I remember Richard Steig.

682
00:56:18,383 --> 00:56:21,283
He worked in our weapons
systems research lab.

683
00:56:21,313 --> 00:56:22,863
He was caught three months ago...

684
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:25,870
...trying to leave the premises
with classified information.

685
00:56:26,043 --> 00:56:27,893
He was terminated immediately.

686
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:30,013
We referred his name to
the justice department.

687
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,993
We have done our due diligence,
agent Dunham.

688
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:38,453
And if you choose to drag our company
and dr. Bell's name into this matter...

689
00:56:38,483 --> 00:56:40,513
...you will be hearing from our attorneys.

690
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:42,204
How long have you worked for dr. Bell?

691
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:44,085
16 years.

692
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:48,063
I owe Massive Dynamic my life,
and that is not an exaggeration.

693
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:50,493
I was a runner most of my life.

694
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:54,853
In the '97 Boston marathon,
I felt strangely tired.

695
00:56:54,863 --> 00:56:57,463
One day at the office,
dr. Bell noticed my discomfort...

696
00:56:57,474 --> 00:56:59,974
...and insisted I go for a cat scan.

697
00:57:00,393 --> 00:57:01,893
Cancer.

698
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:09,043
Spread so severely I had to
have my arm amputated that week.

699
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:14,083
That first scanner that found my
cancer was built by this company.

700
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:16,753
The robotic assist tools there
were used in my surgery...

701
00:57:16,763 --> 00:57:18,534
...the drugs I took afterwards...

702
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,943
were developed and manufactured
by Massive Dynamic.

703
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:27,749
And my replacement limb was
designed by Bell himself.

704
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:33,993
Everything we have on Richard Steig.

705
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:39,323
Do you believe that Steig
may be part of the pattern?

706
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,823
I'm sorry, part of the...

707
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,403
...part of the pattern?

708
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:47,063
Oh, I assumed you had clearance.

709
00:57:48,943 --> 00:57:51,713
Well, I'm cleared to know whatever
you're cleared to know, ms. Sharp.

710
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:53,623
Apparently not.

711
00:57:54,843 --> 00:57:58,293
But suffice to say that we've reached
a point where science and technology...

712
00:57:58,303 --> 00:58:01,503
...have advanced at such an
exponential rate for so long...

713
00:58:01,783 --> 00:58:06,083
...it may be way beyond our ability
to regulate and control them.

714
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:11,633
You should know what you're
getting into, agent Dunham.

715
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:14,522
I would say this to my own daughter.

716
00:58:15,006 --> 00:58:16,706
Be careful...

717
00:58:18,352 --> 00:58:20,552
...and good luck.

718
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:30,223
<font color="#15fcff">Keep the tree warm, Sandy!
We're on our way to your house!</font>

719
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:35,323
And this is a show for children?

720
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:37,093
Yeah, it's huge.

721
00:58:37,571 --> 00:58:41,771
Surprisingly profound for
a narrative about a sponge.

722
00:58:41,973 --> 00:58:43,273
Crazy house.

723
00:58:43,284 --> 00:58:45,284
I just landed at Logan.
I'm on my way to you.

724
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:47,215
I think we've located our suspect.

725
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,203
Hold on a second. You found the guy?

726
00:58:49,213 --> 00:58:50,563
You found the guy from your dream.

727
00:58:50,573 --> 00:58:52,979
<i>I'm picking you both up. I need
your father there to question him...</i>

728
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,363
...get whatever information he needs
so he can make the cure for John.

729
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:57,573
And I need you there too
in case your father's...

730
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,843
Say no more. <i>We'll meet you out front.</i>

731
00:59:04,846 --> 00:59:06,756
<i>Stay eyes on south side.</i>

732
00:59:06,766 --> 00:59:08,856
Red, stand by.

733
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:14,358
<i>Rooftop, confirm your position.</i>

734
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:21,951
Got one coming out.

735
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:24,366
This way, ma'am.

736
00:59:35,382 --> 00:59:39,442
Clear! Clear! Clear!

737
00:59:41,382 --> 00:59:42,791
In the back!

738
01:00:15,366 --> 01:00:17,286
I'd like to check your blood pressure.

739
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:20,500
Why don't you check your own blood
pressure? Mine's fine, thanks.

740
01:00:21,825 --> 01:00:25,293
Your skin tone suggests you might be
suffering from arterial hypertension.

741
01:00:25,304 --> 01:00:27,331
Don't tell me what I'm suffering from.

742
01:00:27,342 --> 01:00:30,442
And there are no visible
signs of hypertension.

743
01:00:33,702 --> 01:00:37,422
When this over, please
don't send me back.

744
01:00:37,432 --> 01:00:38,642
I don't want to go back.

745
01:00:38,652 --> 01:00:39,632
Look, Walter...

746
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:45,152
This experience...
You woke me up again, and...

747
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:47,601
...you can't put me back to sleep.

748
01:00:47,612 --> 01:00:51,412
It was hardly my idea, any of it.

749
01:00:51,862 --> 01:00:56,262
Whatever punishment you think I deserve...

750
01:00:56,932 --> 01:01:00,632
...I swear I have already endured it.

751
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,742
17 years.

752
01:01:04,575 --> 01:01:05,875
Please...

753
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:08,062
...son.

754
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Hey! Hey!

755
01:01:18,564 --> 01:01:19,764
- What?
- Hey!

756
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:21,014
He's in the alley!

757
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:22,064
Can I get out of the car?

758
01:01:22,074 --> 01:01:23,824
Stay right there, Walter!

759
01:02:36,656 --> 01:02:39,156
We've got some questions for you.

760
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:42,924
<font color="#80ff80"><i>U.S.Code 1111.</i></font>

761
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:45,654
<font color="#80ff80"><i>The murder of 147 passengers.</i></font>

762
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:48,294

763
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:50,904
<font color="#80ff80"><i>Use of weapons of mass destruction.</i></font>

764
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,173

765
01:02:53,184 --> 01:02:56,494

767
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,840
<font color="#80ff80"><i>Attempted murder of a federal agent.</i></font>

768
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:03,471
You want immunity.

769
01:03:03,765 --> 01:03:06,610
I want a detailed
account of all the synthetic...

770
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:09,175
...chemicals you had
in that storage facility.

771
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:13,868
Write them down,
and then we can talk about an agreement.

772
01:03:20,226 --> 01:03:24,626
I... have nothing... to say.

773
01:03:52,297 --> 01:03:54,797
Walter, stay here.

774
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:56,544
Where are you...

775
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:12,721
The compound affecting agent Scott...

776
01:04:12,731 --> 01:04:14,931
...it's water soluble, right?

777
01:04:15,531 --> 01:04:19,351
We might not know what it
is, but we know what it does.

778
01:04:19,371 --> 01:04:24,071
So if I wanted to, I could extract the
contaminated fluids from his body...

779
01:04:24,472 --> 01:04:27,772
...and that would allow me to slip
it to you whenever I wanted to.

780
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:32,095
In your food.

781
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:34,450
A cup of coffee.

782
01:04:34,461 --> 01:04:36,461
The toilet.

783
01:04:36,684 --> 01:04:39,184
Nobody would ever know how it happened.

784
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,271
The only problem is...

785
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:45,671
...the woman who was just in here,
that's her friend who's dying.

786
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:48,681
So I just don't have that kind of time.

787
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:50,306
No!

788
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:52,611
Tell me the chemicals!

789
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:54,991
Hey, stop, stop! You
can't! You can't do that.

790
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:56,791
No, you can't do that.

791
01:04:56,801 --> 01:04:58,351
I want the names of the chemicals.

792
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,461
I'm gonna count to one.

793
01:05:02,141 --> 01:05:03,641
One!

794
01:05:03,911 --> 01:05:06,811
The active toxin was a
magnesium based ethylene glycol.

795
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:08,500
No, I understand that, but
you're not listening to me.

796
01:05:08,511 --> 01:05:11,239
Magnesium ethylene glycol
with an organophosphate trig...

797
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,572
Walter, just stop for a second.

798
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:14,837
His blood won't be able to absorb
it before the side-effects kill him.

799
01:05:14,848 --> 01:05:15,683
So you're saying what?

800
01:05:15,694 --> 01:05:19,830
We synthesize a calcium
gluconate in a thiamine base?

801
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:20,700
Yes, exactly.

802
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:23,270
We can't. We'd need more of his blood.
We have none.

803
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,030
That's not true.

804
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:28,040
All agents are required to set up a
backup blood supply in case we're wounded.

805
01:05:28,316 --> 01:05:30,416
Autologous transfusion.
That's brilliant.

806
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:33,967
We can create the antidote and then just
dissolve it into Scott's stored blood.

807
01:05:33,978 --> 01:05:37,108
If we transfuse him intravenously,
his body won't be overwhelmed.

808
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,489
A+, boy. Well done. Let's begin.

809
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:05,723
So I got the lab.

810
01:06:06,474 --> 01:06:08,779
Yeah, I know you did.

811
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,818
Thanks.

812
01:06:14,446 --> 01:06:16,446
How's it goin' downstairs?

813
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:25,186
Bishop says it'll be awhile,
but that it's looking auspicious.

814
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:27,514
That was his word.

815
01:06:29,034 --> 01:06:29,975
What?

816
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:32,756
You've done some solid work here.

817
01:06:32,974 --> 01:06:37,574
Locating Bishop. Getting him out.
Finding a way to get him to work with you.

818
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,794
We're impressed.

819
01:06:40,074 --> 01:06:41,774
Who's "we"?

820
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:44,482
What happened on that
plane might be part of...

821
01:06:44,493 --> 01:06:46,966
...something more dangerous
than just simple terrorism.

822
01:06:46,977 --> 01:06:49,199
Simple terrorism?

823
01:06:51,484 --> 01:06:53,784
In the past nine months,
there have been three dozen...

824
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:56,207
...authenticated incidents
like the Hamburg flight.

825
01:06:57,187 --> 01:07:00,843
John Thompson, normal kid,
went missing back in '98.

826
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:05,194
Reappeared last month halfway
around the world. Hadn't aged a day.

827
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:10,034
In the past few months, 46 other children
who went missing that same year turn up.

828
01:07:10,044 --> 01:07:11,844
Same story.

829
01:07:12,564 --> 01:07:15,057
Local fisherman off the
coast of Sri Lanka...

830
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:17,782
...reports a low-flying plane emitting
a high-pitch frequency...

831
01:07:17,793 --> 01:07:19,863
...that blows out all their windows.

832
01:07:19,874 --> 01:07:21,844
An hour later, same spot...

833
01:07:21,854 --> 01:07:27,874
...an 8.7 sub-surface earthquake creates
a tsunami that kills 83,000 people.

834
01:07:28,013 --> 01:07:30,120
- So why are you telling me...
- This man.

835
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:32,728
A patient in Lisbon who
woke up after years in a coma...

836
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:35,291
...began writing just numbers.

837
01:07:35,393 --> 01:07:37,417
They turn out to be
exact real-time coordinates...

838
01:07:37,442 --> 01:07:39,982
...of our carrier battle
groups in the pacific.

839
01:07:40,573 --> 01:07:43,165
Intel that's classified
above top-secret.

840
01:07:43,176 --> 01:07:44,962
So how is that even possible?

841
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:47,343
Come work for me,
and I'll get you the clearance...

842
01:07:47,353 --> 01:07:48,719
Oh, stop.

843
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:49,722
Dunham, there's more you need to hear.

844
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,633
You must not have heard me. I said stop.

845
01:07:51,643 --> 01:07:53,363
They're calling these
events "the pattern."

846
01:07:53,383 --> 01:07:56,303
As if someone out there is experimenting,
only the whole world is their lab.

847
01:07:56,313 --> 01:07:57,570
You've seen it, now you know.

848
01:07:57,581 --> 01:07:59,214
I don't wanna know. I have a job.

849
01:07:59,225 --> 01:08:00,972
This is a more important job.

850
01:08:00,983 --> 01:08:03,943
Anything, anybody you
need, you can have.

851
01:08:03,953 --> 01:08:05,838
I like the job I've got.

852
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:09,349
And the man I do it with. Which you
seem to have deduced on your own.

853
01:08:09,393 --> 01:08:11,093
Look around.

854
01:08:11,104 --> 01:08:13,084
You see all these people
going about their lives.

855
01:08:13,095 --> 01:08:16,595
No idea what's happening around
them, what they're in the middle of.

856
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:20,052
I just wanna go back to before.

857
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:26,883
Dunham. I don't think you can.

858
01:09:26,515 --> 01:09:27,765
He's up. He's awake.

859
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,336
Olivia, Olivia, he's awake!
He's conscious.

860
01:09:30,478 --> 01:09:31,602
John?

861
01:09:33,784 --> 01:09:36,684
John, can you hear me, baby?

862
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:38,469
Baby?

863
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:41,524
I had a dream about you.

864
01:10:08,935 --> 01:10:11,659
Uh, a change of clothes for agent Scott.

865
01:10:12,355 --> 01:10:15,107
His vitals are surprisingly strong.

866
01:10:15,894 --> 01:10:18,670
So, um, how long does he have to stay?

867
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:20,788
Until the melanocytes in
his skin have regenerated...

868
01:10:20,813 --> 01:10:22,517
...but that shouldn't
be more than a week.

869
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:25,217
He owes you his life.

870
01:10:25,977 --> 01:10:27,907
We owe each other.

871
01:10:33,778 --> 01:10:35,998
What room is Steig in?

872
01:10:38,003 --> 01:10:40,793
I told you everything I know. Didn't I?

873
01:10:40,818 --> 01:10:44,116
I gave you the names of all the
synthetics I used in the compound.

874
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:47,146
Don't worry, our
immunity agreement holds.

875
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:49,341
But there's still a whole lot
more we have to talk about.

876
01:10:49,366 --> 01:10:51,266
Like, why you killed your own brother?

877
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:52,771
And who you're selling your work to?

878
01:10:52,796 --> 01:10:54,556
Who says I was selling it?

879
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:57,841
I was threatened by a
guy from your office.

880
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,936
You think I'm lying?

881
01:11:00,461 --> 01:11:02,591
I swear to God.

882
01:11:02,816 --> 01:11:06,656
I can prove it.
I recorded the conversation.

883
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:09,751
- Where's the recording?
- I buried it.

884
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:53,811
<font color="#80ff80"><i>Who is this?</i></font>

885
01:11:53,836 --> 01:11:55,520
<font color="#80ff80"><i>We had an exchange agreement.</i></font>

886
01:11:55,684 --> 01:11:57,655
<font color="#80ff80"><i>Hmm, there have been other bidders.</i></font>

887
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,385
<font color="#80ff80"><i>Today, the airplane was a demonstration.</i></font>

888
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:02,333
<font color="#80ff80"><i>You've drawn unwarranted attention.</i></font>

889
01:12:02,343 --> 01:12:05,277
<font color="#80ff80"><i>Something we can't afford
to be connected with.</i></font>

890
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:07,421
<font color="#80ff80"><i>I'll make this simple. You're
not selling to anyone else.</i></font>

891
01:12:07,432 --> 01:12:08,933
<font color="#80ff80"><i>You do that, we will come after you.</i></font>

892
01:12:08,943 --> 01:12:10,933
<font color="#80ff80"><i>I will come after you.</i></font>

893
01:12:10,943 --> 01:12:14,867
<font color="#80ff80"><i>You're threatening me after seeing what
I'm willing to do to my own brother?</i></font>

894
01:12:14,878 --> 01:12:17,840
<font color="#80ff80"><i>Well, let me assure you, we'd be
happy to treat you as family too.</i></font>

895
01:12:17,865 --> 01:12:21,585
Well, let me assure you. We'd be
happy to treat you as family too.

896
01:12:34,913 --> 01:12:36,101
Special agent Scott.

897
01:12:36,112 --> 01:12:38,053
Yes, sir, go right ahead.

898
01:13:06,285 --> 01:13:09,328
Charlie, I need two agents posted
outside agent Scott's room now.

899
01:13:09,339 --> 01:13:10,589
Check on Steig.

900
01:13:10,745 --> 01:13:12,025
<i>I'm on it.</i>

901
01:13:12,035 --> 01:13:14,105
I'm five minutes away.

902
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:20,053
We need this place locked down!

903
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:35,999
This is Dunham, agent I.D.52776 in pursuit
of blue suv heading south on fenway.

904
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,870
Need immediate assist.

905
01:15:31,616 --> 01:15:34,836
Ask yourself why...

906
01:15:38,126 --> 01:15:39,502
...why...

907
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:46,415
...Broyles sent you
to the storage facility.

908
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:50,258
Why you?

909
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:53,423
Why? I don't understand.

910
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,918
Who are you working for?

911
01:15:59,445 --> 01:16:02,425
John, tell me.

912
01:16:02,435 --> 01:16:05,195
Tell me more, John.

913
01:16:59,089 --> 01:17:01,829
I knew him just as long as you did.

914
01:17:06,105 --> 01:17:07,905
I'm sorry.

915
01:17:10,674 --> 01:17:13,754
Job isn't what it was ten years ago.

916
01:17:15,515 --> 01:17:17,805
We're supposed to protect a world...

917
01:17:18,315 --> 01:17:22,875
...where one breath of the wrong air can
incinerate you from the inside out.

918
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,260
I mean, how do we protect people...

919
01:17:27,654 --> 01:17:32,854
...when corporations have higher
security clearances than we do?

920
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:37,929
When we're not fully briefed on half
the things that we're investigating?

921
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,896
You know, when the truth...

922
01:17:44,378 --> 01:17:49,938
...the truth is we're obsolete.

923
01:17:54,097 --> 01:17:56,401
Take me back to the lab.

924
01:18:15,527 --> 01:18:17,797
Can I talk to you please?

925
01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:19,717
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.

926
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:24,277
Though I'm sure you're anxious to
get as far away from here as possible.

927
01:18:24,287 --> 01:18:27,857
To Iraq or Afghanistan or
countless other out of reach places...

928
01:18:27,867 --> 01:18:30,207
...but I'm here to tell you that
your father needs to stay.

929
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:33,707
Which means that you need to too.

930
01:18:33,817 --> 01:18:34,877
Are you okay?

931
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:37,463
No, I know that
you have countless reasons...

932
01:18:37,487 --> 01:18:40,727
...as to why this
is a non-starter for you.

933
01:18:40,737 --> 01:18:43,867
But, I mean, your father is a good man.

934
01:18:43,877 --> 01:18:45,957
He's not the monster you think he is.

935
01:18:45,967 --> 01:18:48,167
And you're good with him,
despite what you think.

936
01:18:48,177 --> 01:18:50,617
And you're the only
one who speaks Walter.

937
01:18:50,637 --> 01:18:53,227
We take him back to st.
Claire's and it's all over.

938
01:18:53,237 --> 01:18:54,608
Where's John?

939
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,397
I can talk to the agency and get
them to clear your gambling debts.

940
01:18:57,407 --> 01:19:02,237
I can take care of my own debts,
okay? What just happened? Where's John?

941
01:19:02,247 --> 01:19:04,617
I'm not gonna use false
threats with you anymore.

942
01:19:04,627 --> 01:19:06,236
I don't need to.

943
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:09,637
The threats are real.

944
01:19:12,807 --> 01:19:16,557
After you left, my father sat down,
and started talking to me and he was...

945
01:19:16,902 --> 01:19:18,884
...remarkably lucid.

946
01:19:19,617 --> 01:19:22,487
He told me about the work that he and
William Bell had done their experiments.

947
01:19:22,497 --> 01:19:27,567
And that incident... what happened
on the plane is just the beginning.

948
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:33,697
Which makes every part of me feel
like I gotta get the hell outta Boston.

949
01:19:37,587 --> 01:19:39,747
Are we leaving?

950
01:19:40,886 --> 01:19:42,881
Are we leaving?

951
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,507
How long has he been dead?

952
01:20:23,517 --> 01:20:24,948
Five hours.

953
01:20:27,807 --> 01:20:29,477
Question him.

St. Claire's for 17 years.

155

I saw that. An assistant
was killed in his lab.

156
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,373
Rumors about Dr. Bishop
using humans as guinea pigs.

157
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,450
He was charged with manslaughter,
but deemed mentally unfit.

158
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,110
- Why're you so sure he's worth our time?
- Why are you so sure he's not?

159

Listen, you and I got
off on the wrong foot.

160
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,288
If my past job performance as U.S.
Marine Special Investigator offends you...

161
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,430
Well, yeah, it does.

162
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,623
A man who serves
his country 30 years...

163
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,892
has a few drinks, a
lapse in judgment...

164
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,869
A lapse in judgment that will haunt
three women for the rest of their lives.

165
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,599
But that's not
tonight's business, is it?

166
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,200
Look, D.C. has tasked
me to make sure...

167
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,313
that our reaction to Flight
627 is beyond reproach.

Now, it says here...

169
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,916
in 1991 the glorious state of
Massachusetts forbade Dr. Bishop...

170
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,750
from having any visitors, with
the exception of immediate family.

171

institution waving the Patriot Act...

time with some old lab rat...

most terrifying terror I can imagine...

I'm coming to you with a lead,
and your personal resentment...

176

You're wasting your breath and my time.
Do you understand "immediate family"?

177

You wanna question Dr. Bishop, go
find his next of kin, have them escort you.

178

Talk to Bishop, uncover something
substantial, and I will have your back.

Until then, I am not so convinced.
Now, can you handle that?

your fields and the port.

Someone who has a handle on
the laws of hydrodynamic resistance.

The heat exchange

Someone who can
work with mixed integers.

You're gonna have to resize as
you work across uneven terrain.

My father. Not my favorite.

He worked out of a
basement lab in Harvard...

doing research for a
toothpaste company.

Excellent. First words. Perfect.

312

No, as a boy, you were rounder.

313

before high school.

- No. Guardian? No. Forget it.
- He'll do it.

00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,475
- No, I will not do it.
- One phone call. That's all it takes.

Do you want me to make it? Because
I've got my phone in my pocket.

OLIVIA: Dr. Bishop,
I was curious.

337
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,764
Did anyone else ever
have access to your work?

338
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:46,599
Well, uh, the assistants
had bits and pieces.

339
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,939
God, I suppose.

340
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,277
I suppose the only one that really
knew what I was doing was Belly.

- Who?
- Belly. William Bell.

- He and I shared the lab.
- William Bell?

You shared your lab with the
founder of Massive Dynamic?

I'm sorry. I don't know what
that is, Massive Dynamic.

Nothing, really. Just a tiny

The other guy becomes an
institutionalized psychopath.

- Oh!
- What? What happened?

349
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,898
I just pissed myself.

- Worse.

CDC says the flight was
caused by a synthetic compound...

354
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,523
which is like saying rain is
caused by a wet compound.

They've run tests on John, but
haven't come back with anything.

- He and Bishop used to share a lab.

for storage for the last 17 years.

It would be nice to think that
your tenacity in this case...

393
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,169
is a by-product of a remarkable
and robust professionalism.

394
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,413

on between you and Agent Scott.

I could help, yes, if I
had a precise inventory...

461
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,772
of what was in that storage
facility when it detonated...

462
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,433
We don't have it. It
all went up. Everything.

463
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,772
The suspect, who might
have answers, got away.

464
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,040
And John was the only
one who saw his face.

465
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,844
So how long does he have left?

466
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:30,483
Current rate of crystallization,
cellular degradation...

467
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,624
- How long?
- Twenty-four hours.

468
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,459
His brain will no longer
be able to oxygenate itself.

469
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,290
I'm so sorry...

470
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,301
that I can't offer you a
less dangerous solution.

471
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,238
- What do you mean?
- Didn't I mention it?

472
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,640
Whatever you think
you said, you didn't say.

473
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,303
The synaptic transfer system,
the shared dream state.

474
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,177
What do you mean,
shared dream state?

475
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,514
The human brain generates
a quantifiable electric field.

476
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:07,057
I posited in 1976
that it is possible...

477
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:10,662
to synchronize the fields
of two distinct minds...

478
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:15,232
to allow the sharing of information
across the unconscious state.

479
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,892
Like a string
between two tin cans.

480
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:21,369
And you know what's great about
that is that it's completely insane.

481
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,237
You're saying I can
talk to John in a coma...

482
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,403
and he can tell me what
the suspect looks like?

483
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,572
- It's not an exact science.
PETER: It's not even science.

484
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,583
- Have you done this before?
- I have used this technique...

485
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,551
to extract information
from a corpse, once.

486
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,921
You can do that if they
haven't been dead for six hours.

487
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,721
Right, because after six
hours, they're really dead.

488
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:47,525
You could access his memories.
Assuming there's no brain damage.

489
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,395
Of course, you'd have to have
an electromagnetic probe...

490
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,400
placed in the
base of your skull...

491
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,369
whilst immersed without
clothing in the old tank.

492
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,406
And you'd be heavily drugged.

493
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,143
- What sort of drugs?
- A mix of...

494
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:10,379
Ketamine, Neurontin,
Lysergic Acid Diethylamide.

495
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,786
That last one is LSD
by the way. Acid?

496
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,984
It'd take a few hours. I'd
need your help to synthesize it.

497
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,493
- If it's not too much trouble.
- Sure, sounds fun.

498
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,291
The man who was released
from the mental institution...

499
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:24,459
wants to give you an overdose,
stick a rod in your head...

500
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,104
and put you naked into
a rusty tank of water.

501
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,933
No, I don't want to.

502
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,906
No, I'd rather not.
I'm just saying I can.

503
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,510
Okay, Olivia. Heh.

504
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,271
Excuse me. You're
obviously under severe duress.

505
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,611
You haven't slept since Iraq,
the man you care about might die.

506
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:44,620
- But I'm telling you, that will kill you.
- You don't understand the procedure.

507
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,457
John would do it for me.

508
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:55,928
Set it up. I'll get DHS
authorization to bring John here.

509
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,099
This is unbelievable.
This is insane.

510
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:03,230
He is insane. And you're
insane for following him.

511
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:06,434
Excellent. Let's make some LSD.

512
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,789
OLIVIA: Put him over here.

513

ASTRID: Salt'll make you float.

Charlie, did you get me
in to see William Bell?

515

Massive Dynamic isn't exactly
being forthcoming or courteous.

And apparently William
Bell is out of the country.

What's this?

518
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,353
A sweet little memo
from their general counsel.

519
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,829
- Bell doesn't wanna talk?
- Or he's the head...

- Screw this.

I wanna drive a tank through
Bell's office. Find out what he knows.

be the only one to save us.

OLIVIA: Our primary suspect
is a former employee of yours...

637
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:51,240
Richard Steig, who may have
used research from your company...

638
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:54,010
to develop a
self-eradicating airborne toxin.

We don't know why or for whom...

to sacrifice his own brother.

I remember Richard Steig.

646
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,978
He worked in our
weapons-systems research lab.

647
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:33,054
He was caught three months ago trying
to leave with classified information.

648
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,785
He was terminated. We referred
his name to the justice department.

649
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,953
We have done our due
diligence, Agent Dunham...

and if you choose to
drag our company...

651
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,392

into this matter...

00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,561
you will be hearing
from our attorneys.

653
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:51,140
- How long have you worked for Dr. Bell?
- Sixteen years.

654
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:54,574
I owe Massive Dynamic my life,
and that is not an exaggeration.

655
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,510
I was a runner most of my life.

656
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:01,742
In the '97 Boston Marathon,
I felt strangely tired.

657
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:04,582
One day at the office,
Dr. Bell noticed my discomfort...

658
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,589
and insisted I go
for a CAT scan.

659
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,454
Cancer.

660
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,456
It spread so severely...

661
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:16,532
I had to have my arm
amputated that week.

662
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:20,829
That first scanner that found my
cancer was built by this company.

663
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,670
The robotic assist tools
used in my surgery...

664
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,468
the drugs I took afterwards...

665
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:29,306
were developed and
manufactured by Massive Dynamic...

666
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:34,614
and my replacement limb
was designed by Bell himself.

on Richard Steig.

may be part of The Pattern?

Apparently not.

point where science and technology...

exponential rate for so long...

ability to regulate and control them.

way to get him to work with you.

- We're impressed.
- Who's "we"?

773
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:54,066
What happened on that plane might
be part of something more dangerous...

774
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,839
- than just simple terrorism.
- "Simple" terrorism?

775
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,845
In the past nine months, there
have been three dozen incidents...

776
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,885
like the Hamburg flight.

777
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:09,085
John Thompson, normal
kid, went missing back in '98...

778
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:13,196
reappeared last month halfway
around the world. Hadn't aged a day.

46 other children...

year turn up. Same story.

Fisherman off the coast of Sri
Lanka reports a low-flying plane...

782
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:28,033
emitting a high-pitched frequency
that blows out all their windows.

783
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:32,114
An hour later, same spot, an
8.7 subsurface earthquake...

784
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,252

that kills 83,000 people.

- This man:

Patient in Lisbon who woke up
after years in a coma, began writing.

787
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:45,386
Just numbers. They turn out to
be exact, real-time coordinates...

788
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,259
of our carrier battle
groups in the Pacific.

above top secret.

Come work for me. I'll
get you the clearance...

- There's more you need to hear.

- You must not have heard me.
- They're calling the events The Pattern...

794

as if someone's experimenting,
only the world is their lab.

- I don't wanna know.

- I have a job.
- This is a more important job.

I gave you the names of all the

Don't worry, our

I can prove it.
